Session Buddy is a browser tab and bookmark manager that gives you a consistent way to manage both your tabs and bookmarks, making it easy to flow from one to the other.

## Open tabs at a glance

Session Buddy provides a live browser-level view of all of your open tabs, grouped by window.

From this view, you can perform tab-related actions like saving tabs, copying tabs, opening tabs from a list of URLs, or doing some housecleaning by easily identifying and closing the tabs you no longer need.

This view also includes a history timeline that shows the state of open windows and tabs at specific points in the past.

## From tabs to bookmarks and back

Session Buddy lets you save your open tabs as a collection of bookmarks with a single click.

A collection can later be restored, again with just one click, to resume browsing with all windows and tabs exactly as they were.

## Collections

Bookmarks, also known as links, are stored in collections. A collection typically represents a saved session or a set of links focused around a particular topic.

Collections can be organized just the way you like, searched, and shared in a variety of formats.

#### Folders

Links in collections are grouped by folder. This mirrors the structure of windows and tabs, facilitating the flow from a session to a collection and vice versa.

When tabs are saved as a collection, each window becomes a folder. Similarly, when a collection is opened, each of its folders opens as a window.

Windows opened from a collection maintain their original size and location. Other states like pinned tabs and incognito windows are also preserved.
